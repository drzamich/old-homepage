# My first homepage from 2007

### https://drzamich.github.io/old-homepage/

I resurrected my first homepage from 2007. Isn't it beautiful? ðŸ¥¹

At the time, I was 14 years old and deeply passionate about web development or "webmastering," as it was called back then. I had been building websites for about a year and decided it was time to create a personal homepage, a must-have for every respected webmaster.

Despite being a novice, I must have been quite confident in my skills, as much of the content on my homepage was advices for other webmasters. Web standards were very important to me, and I wanted to do everything in my power to spread the knowledge.

I still remember how proud I was that my website passed the W3C markup validation and featured rounded corners, gradients, and equally sized columns, all without using `<table>` elements! This was during a time when Internet Explorer 6 and 7 has abour 75% market share, and CSS features like `border-radius` were still years away from real browser support.

This is actually v3 (or reather v0.7, according to the changelog) of the homepage. The initial version is forever lost but I still remember that there was this huge banner encouraging visitors to install Opera. Oh I really disliked Internet Explorer.

I think I should start putting "18 years of experience" on my resume.
